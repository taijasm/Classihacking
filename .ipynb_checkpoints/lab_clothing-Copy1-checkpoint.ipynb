    "We can also get a notion of which features are important in the classification process by seeing how they correlate with the response. Implement some code to obtain the Pearson correlation coefficient between each of our features and the response. Do this on the training set only! Create a dataframe indexed by the features, which has columns `abscorr` the absolute value of the correlation and `corr` the value of the correlation. Sort the dataframe by `abscorr`, highest first, and show the top 25 features with the highest absolute correlation. Is there much overlap with the feature selection performed by the LASSO?"

    "One of the reasons feature selection is done, automatically or otherwise, is that there might be strong correlations between features. Also recall polynomial regression: a large number of features can lead to overfitting. Feature selection helps curb the problem of the curse of dimensionality, where centrality measures often used in statistics go wonky at higher dimensions. Between feature-engineering which we did some of, earlier, and feature selection, is where a lot of smarts and domain knowledge comes in. You will gain this with experience."

    "ROC curves are a set of classifiers, many of them, each point corresponding to a different threshold (go read Lab 6 for more details). They are useful to compare classifiers to each other and also to baseline models.\n",
    "(In the standard scenario, where we used the  classifier accuracy, this threshold is implicitly set at 0.5, and we have only one point on the ROC curve.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical way to do this is to order the samples by probability of being positive, or in the case of the SVM, by the `decision_function` or distance from the separating hyperplane. Then consider the sample with the highest score or highest probability of being positive. At first, only this sample is positive. Then, we take the sample with the next highest score, and call it positive. As we go down the list, we go down a threshold in score or probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each such situation: only 1 positive, now 2 positive,....you can imagine a different classifier with a different confusion matrix. It will have its own false positives, three positives, etc. Its actually the same original classifier, but with a different threshold each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we keep going down the list, decreasing the threshold, more and more samples become positive, and at first, the true positives rise faster than the false positives. Once past a certain point, false positives increase faster than true positives. Now, if you want a balanced classifier, you look at this turn-around point...the northwest corner, so to speak. But if you want a classifier which penalizes false positives and false negatives differently, the point you want is different.\n",

    "To make a ROC curve you plot the True Positive Rate, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A rote reading of the ROC curve (go to the \"northwest\" corner) is a bad idea: you must fold in the curve with any assumptions you are making about the utilities. In our case we have both an asymmetric data set, and asymmetric risk, so the north west corner may not be the right spot. Still, on the whole, a curve with a greater AUC (area under curve), or further away from the line of randomness, will give us a rough idea of what might be a better classifier."

    "The proof is always in the pudding. So far we have seen the ROC curve which implements one classifier per threshold to pick an appropriate model. But why not just plot the profit on a ROC like curve to see which classifier maximizes profit? \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a ROC curve, we go down the sorted (by score or probability) list of samples. We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. In addition to what we do for the ROC curve, we now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",
